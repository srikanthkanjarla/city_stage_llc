  For us who are not going out of town for labor day weekend. Let's meet at lake
  Balboa park and have a bbq picnic with board games and other fun active games.
  Will have music to listen to and mingle. This is a pot luck picnic so bring
  anything you like to share with the group. Share in the comments what you are
  bringing so we won't have too many of the same stuff. Also, it's fun to
  carpool. So post it in the comment if your willing to carpool with others.
  This will be cross-posted with a few other groups.
