For us who are not going out of town for labor day weekend. Let's meet at lake Balboa park and have a bbq picnic with board games and other fun active games. Will have music to listen to and mingle. This is a pot luck picnic so bring anything you like to share with the group. Share in the comments what you are bringing so we wont have to many of the same stuff. Also it's fun to carpool. So post it in the comment if your willing to carpool with others. This will be cross posted with few other groups.
