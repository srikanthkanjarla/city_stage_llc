We are a group of small business owners in Sydney's inner west who like meeting new people and learning about their businesses. Come and network over your favourite morning beverage with optional breakfast for those feeling hungry. It’s often not the people in the room but rather who we know and can refer you to that can grow your business. We strive to create a friendly, relaxed environment where just getting to know one another can result in some great business connections and maybe even start your day a little wiser than the day before. Don’t struggle through on your own. Come and have a Koffee Business Chat.
